      <div class="about-mission"> We are on a mission to get our shelter dogs outside to play.</div>
      <div class="about-explanation">Unfortunately, dogs who are left in shelters get very little time for interaction
          and outdoor play due to limited shelter staff and resources.</div>
      <div class="about-explanation">Thats why we came up with an app to connect people with dogs in our shelter.</div>
      <div class="about-explanation">Our app makes it easy to log in, and select an available dog in our shelter
        to take out for an afternoon adventure!</div>
        <div class="about-explanation">When you check your dog back into the shelter, you have the option 
        to upload a review our shelter can use as marketing material to get our dogs adopted!</div>
      <div class="about-images-text">
        <div class="about-dogs">We love seeing our shelter dogs get out and play!</div>
